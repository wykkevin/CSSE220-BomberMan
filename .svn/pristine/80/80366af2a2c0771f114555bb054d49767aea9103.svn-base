Based on the UML diagram we draw, we make a class of Monster, Hero, GameComponent, and bomb.
We pick pictures for our hero, monsters, bomb, and different types of walls.
We design several maps, which we can use "u" and "d" to switching between maps.
We add a method called "moveable" to make sure hero and monster cannot across the wall.
The hero we make can actually put bombs down, but because we are on the half way of making the bomb, the bomb cannot explode.
Also, we make monsters that cannot move at this time.
