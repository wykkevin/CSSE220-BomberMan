We focus on bomb this time.
The first step is to make the bomb explode successfully. So we add explodehelpler 
and explode to make it explode.
Also, the bomb can kill the wall and monster.
When the bomb kill the hero, the hero will back to position(0,0), because we do not have
"life" of the hero.
At last, we make two different monsters that can randomely appear at the map, and they can
move ramdomely.
