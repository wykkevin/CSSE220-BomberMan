We first add an animation of exploding of the bomb.
Then we make one "boss monster", which can test if the hero is around him. If he notices that
the hero is nearby, he will "flash" to escape.
Furthermore, we add one additional Power-up, which is the timebomb. 
The player can control if the bomb should explode by press "E" on the keyboard.
Then we add start and end frames, which guide the player.
At last, we add save and continue button which enables the player to store and read what he has played.
