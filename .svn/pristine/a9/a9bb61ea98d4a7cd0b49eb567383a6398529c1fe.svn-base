First, we make the monster can kill the hero when they meet.
Then we design the Power-ups, which is that when the hero destroy a wall, the Power-ups will
be in that position.
There are three kinds of Power-ups, the first one is "bubble", which can increase the bomb
that the hero makes at the same time.
The second one is called "Power", which can strengthen the area the bomb can destroy.
The last on is "Bonus Life", which can increase one life to our hero.
Also, we use three pictures of each Power-up.
Then we design that when we kill all the monsters on the map, it will automatically change to the next map.
